# Ansible

Ansible is a pretty simple, straight forward method of describing desired infrastructure state.  Though it seems simple, I've seen respositories that have gotten completely out of hand and they are in a state that I would consider unmanagable.


## Usage

`ansible-playbook -i inventory/dev.hosts site.yml`
