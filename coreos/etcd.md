# ETCD

Etcd is a utility built into Coreos.  It provides a key/ value store available across multiple Coreos servers enabling them to cooperate as a single cluter.  You can utilize etcd directly through a shell, or via programming languages where etcd libraries have been written.  Coreos provides an online discover service to help form clusters at the endpoint `https://discovery.etcd.io`.
