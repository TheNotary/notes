### FAQ

- You can use util.promisify to convert any callback based function to a promise-based one.

###### Q:
I'm working with node and the filesystem quite a bit, and am noticing how tricky it is to do fs.readFile commands because they work based on callbacks.  Is there a way to use them so they return promises?

###### A:
Yes, starting with Node.js v8.0.0, the util.promisify function was introduced. This function converts a callback-based function into a Promise-based one. Here's how you can use it with fs.readFile:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const util = require('util');

const readFile = util.promisify(fs.readFile);

readFile('/path/to/file', 'utf8')
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('There was an error reading the file!', error);
  });
```
